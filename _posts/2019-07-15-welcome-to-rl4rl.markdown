Reinforcement Learning is a powerful tool in Artificial Intelligence in which software agents learn to optimize their decision making towards a long term goal. Traditionally, this is done in virtual environments or simulations in which the agent may experiment for an almost limitless number of attempts. In many real-life tasks, this is simply not possible as data is scarce. Instead, observed statistics are often modelled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) for applying Reinforcement Learning.
 
 However, achieving this (both modelling the environment and applying the algorithms) requires an advanced understanding of the methods needed and, for many real-life domains, those that have access to the data are not specialists in this area. Therefore, we introduce this work as an attempt to enable and encourage the use of Reinforcement Learning for real-life tasks by making is more accessible to those working in these domains. This is achieved by:
 
    - Defining the process required to model the environment as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
    - Introducing an R/Python package that can be applied on the MDP for training an agent.
    - Writing clear educational examples which are added to the documentation to demonstrate the possible use cases for applying Reinforcement Learning to real-life tasks.
    - Encouraging a community to showcase their work and novel applications, further increasing the number of use cases. 
    
Prior to formalising the methods in this work, we have published short education articles that outline these steps on Medium and code notebooks on Kaggle (data science website of Google). Most notably in two projects; "Planning Meals with Reinforcement Learning" and "Improving a Player's Decision Making in Video Games". Both were awarded monetary prizes by Kaggle for their value to the community and have a total of 15,000 views on Medium highlighting the interest for considering new ways to apply Reinforcement Learning. 

We hope you find this project valuable. If you have any questions, please visit the GitHub page or contact us directly.
